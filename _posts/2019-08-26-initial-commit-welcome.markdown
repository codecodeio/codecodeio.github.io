Welcome to my blog.

I will post updates about new sites, apps, and features on this site.

In the meantime. Check out this Swift snippet.  If you didn't know thats the programming language that runs modern Apple apps. It is beautifully simple and precise at the same time.  Specifying input and output types makes it precise. No semi-colon's required is zen and beautiful!

{% highlight swift %}
func hello(person: String) -> String {
    let greeting = "Hello, " + person + "!"
    return greeting
}
hello('World')
#=> prints 'Hello, World!'.
{% endhighlight %}
